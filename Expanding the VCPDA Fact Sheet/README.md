# Overview

This fact sheet was a part of my larger capstone project in the Professional and Technical Writing program at Virginia Tech. The project was an advocacy campaign to expand the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act to include protections against applicant tracking systems. The fact sheet was passed around as an informational supplement during our final presentation.
