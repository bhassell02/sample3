# Overview

I worked with editors at Duke's Office of Information Technology to produce an article on a new university web application designed by a group of students in the Code+ summer program.

I got the chance to interview two of the student team members and the faculty team lead to support the article's creation.

The article went through multiple iterations as I met with several editors. The final product [appears on the OIT website](https://oit.duke.edu/news/duke-fixit-rolls-out-fall/).
