# Overview

This is a longer PDF form of a user guide I wrote for MCNC (restricted information redacted). While I generally work in version control software with Markdown, I created a visual PDF version of the guide to experiment with document design.

This was the writing sample that admitted me to the MSTC program at NC State.
